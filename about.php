    <h1>About Us</h1>
	<div class="card shadow--3dp">
	    <p>Hello everybody. We have a radio show that can be listened to on the radio. Funny that.
        We also have a YouTube show that can be watched on YouTube. Quelle surprise.</p>
        <p>The show is a conversation between 3 friends that wind each other up and joke around. 
        Whilst we discuss video games across all platforms (except for THOSE ones).</p>
        <p>We try to keep our listeners up to date with the latest information on games, consoles, developers, peripherals and everything else that you can think of relating to games.
        Generally speaking we will stay on topic but there's a very good chance we will go off on long tangents. If for any reason you do not wish to join us on these journeys (<i>regulars know how these go</i>) 
        feel free to skip ahead 5 seconds, as required, though we do hope you will stay with us during our waffles of interest</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The most minute team description you have ever read</h3>
        <p>Craig and Tim have almost 20 years of video game journalism and broadcasting between them with Cameron playing 'The New Guy'.</p>
